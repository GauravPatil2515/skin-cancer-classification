## 🚀 How to Run the Enhanced Dashboard

### **Option 1: Simple Launch**
```bash
python launch_enhanced.py
```

### **Option 2: Direct Streamlit**
```bash
streamlit run app_enhanced.py
```

### **Option 3: With Environment Setup**
```bash
# 1. Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Edit .env and add your API key
# GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here

# 3. Run dashboard
streamlit run app_enhanced.py
```

## 🔑 API Key Configuration

### **Method 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)**
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your Groq API key to the `.env` file
3. The dashboard will automatically load it

### **Method 2: Runtime Input**
1. Run the dashboard without setting environment variable
2. Enter API key in the sidebar when prompted
3. Key is masked for security

## 🔄 Migration from Original App

### **Immediate Steps:**
1. **Backup**: Keep your original `app.py` as `app_backup.py`
2. **Security**: Remove the hardcoded API key from any production code
3. **Environment**: Set up `.env` file with your API key
4. **Test**: Run the enhanced version to verify all features work

### **API Key Security Migration:**
```bash
# If you were using the hardcoded key, replace it with:
# 1. Environment variable method:
echo "GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env

# 2. Or use the sidebar input method (key entered at runtime)
```
